                            <strong>The programming unit covers the basics of programming in Java.</strong> The first part
                            of the unit is taught with <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a> this is a program that
                            allows users to code simple graphics onto an interface. Then from there its onto using an IDE
                            (in this case eclipse) to write console applications, again in Java. The course covers many topics an
                            overview of which is provided in the list below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Software Life Cycle and Design Methodology</li> <!-- list for 'programing' section -->
                                <li>Verification and testing</li>
                                <li>Application of standards and conventions</li>
                                <li>Constructs and features of high level programming languages
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Abstraction</li> <!-- Nested list for 'features of high level programming languages' -->
                                        <li>Operators</li>
                                        <li>Use of Libraries</li>
                                        <li>Simple I/O</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Data Types</li>
                                <li>Object orientated design</li>
                            </ul>
                            These Concepts arent always taught separately most times they are taught and used togther e.g.
                            once you have learnt programming conventions you will use them throught the other sections, aswell
                            as throught the course and possibly beyond. The image above it an example of a program built using
                            <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a>, its useful when learning programming as its visual and often errors made in the code can
                            be visual seen unlike a console program.

                            This unit provides an introduction to modern web design and development. This means that <strong> it covers
                            both web design which is the visuals of a web page (HTML and CSS) and web development which is the functionality
                            of a web pages and makes use of technologys such as JavaScript,PHP and MySQL.</strong> Some of the topics this
                            course includes are included below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Introduction to the client-server model</li>    <!-- list for 'web development' section -->
                                <li>The use of high-level tools for design and development</li>
                                <li>The production of HTML5 video</li>
                                <li>The DOM element Model</li>
                            </ul>
                            This unit is marked through projects, this website being one of them. This website is used to assess my skills
                            in HTML and CSS, which was covered in the first 7 weeks of the course. I will also create a website which contains a video
                            but this hasn't been implmented as this is part of the next assignment which is control of HTML 5 video through
                            JavaScript. JavaScript is taught up intill the christmas break after this the unit covers the use of PHP and MySQL
                            for the backend of websites.
