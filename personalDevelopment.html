                        <h3><strong> Critical Thinking and Problem Solving </strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Problem solving and critical thinking are key skills in computer science, espically in programming
                                were they are essential. My previous programming projects highlight this, in particualr my 2-player
                                chess game coded in C#. I encountered many issues while building it, for example how to implement
                                the move 'castling' into the game. By thinking through the problem and breacking it down into smaller
                                bits I managed to succesfully implement the feature.

                        <h3><strong> Learning and Research Skills </strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Throughout my current course and in my previous education I have developed 'learning and Research'
                                skills to help myself understand the course material. But ontop of this I self-taught myself to
                                program before enrolling on my current course. This has given me a solid understanding
                                when it comes to learning skills as I had to sourse my own material to learn from. Since I am only in
                                my first year of university I havent done much in the way of proper research but its something I'm looking
                                forward to doing later in the course.

                        <h3><strong> Communication,Teamwork and Leadership skills </strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                My skills in 'Communication,Teamwork and Leadership' are good but could do with some improvement espically
                                Leadership skills simply becuase I havent had many opportunities to practice them. I hope to improve this
                                and plan to do it though the group project in the information systems unit of my current course, as well
                                as attending 'hackathons' run by the University's Computer Science society.
